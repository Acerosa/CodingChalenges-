public class FizzBuzzSolver
{

// FizzBuzz Challenge Instructions

// Objective:
// Implement a method that generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to n, 
// replacing certain numbers with the words "Fizz" and "Buzz" based on specific conditions.

// Method Signature:
// public static string FizzBuzz(int n)


// Create an empty string variable named result to store the final output.


// Use a loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to n.


// For each number i in the loop:
// Initialize an empty string variable named current.
// If i is divisible by 3, append "Fizz" to current.
// If i is divisible by 5, append "Buzz" to current.
// If current is still empty (i.e., i is not divisible by 3 or 5), append i to current.


// Append current to the result string.
// If i is not the last number, append a comma and a space (", ") to result.


// After the loop, return the result string.


// For n = 15, the output should be:
// "1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz"


// You can use the Main method to test your implementation:
public static void Main()
{
    //Console.WriteLine(FizzBuzz(15));
}
